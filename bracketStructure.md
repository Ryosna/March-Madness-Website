In total, there are 68 teams participating in March Madness. Out of those 68 teams, up to 36 teams are chosen as "at-large" teams. All 68 teams are then assigned a seed from 1-68, based on qualitative assessment.

First Four:
8 teams are selected to compete for the First Four. This is usually the four lowest non-at-large seeds and the four lowest at-large seeds. The teams play each - four games total - and 4 teams emerge victorious. This allows the 4 teams to be eliminated, and the 64 teams that are remaining enter the round of 64.

Tournament:
The 64 teams are divided into four quadrants based on regions - East, South, Midwest, and West - and so each quadrant holds 16 teams. The teams of each regions get regional seeds for their regions, ranking from 1-16 (this is not to be confused with the permanent seeds - the ones going from 1-68). This year, the matchups for the first are predetermined by seed: 1/16, 8/9, 4/13, 5/12, 2/15, 7/10, 3/14, 6/11. 

Basically, from here it works like a standard tournament going from 64 to 32 to 16 (Sweet Sixteen) to 8 (Elite Eight) and to 4 (Final Four), where one team from each region will be in it. I'm not completely sure which region will play which though. Then it goes to 2 teams - the championship - and the winner of the whole thing will be determined then.

i hope this was helpful
