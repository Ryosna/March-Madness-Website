# March-Madness-Website
Documenting all the work done for a school project that revolves around march madness. 
After Coronavirus was threatening the town, the school closed down and the project as since been shut down. Also COVID-19 made the ncaa close as well so project is just dead. 
It's not a complete failure. We learned a lot in just the span of a couple weeks. 
I'm gonna archieve this so that in the future, I can see how far I've come if I choose to go deeper into web dev. 
Until then, 
Good luck, Future Me.
